# To Do List
- [] Case Study: layout, developer-rectangles, ratios
- [x] Pathway and Directory Reading of file names
- Drawing 2D Music Buttons: all buttons happen together
  - [x] All drawings start with same X&Y Variables (will be received parameters)
  - [x] All drawings have scale factor for X&Y Dimensions (will be received parameters)
  - [x] Order of populating variables is mandatory, to use a variable it must be populated first, after size()
  - [x] Pause is the center button, all are relative to this
  - [x] Play Triangle over top of Pause Shapes, based on single starting point and pause variables
  - [x] Stop Square prototyped to the front of all buttons (stop, prev, reverse-skip, play-pause, forward-skip, next, Loop PlayList), with mute and other loops place appropriately (use developer rectangles for symmetrical spacing)
  - [x] List all buttons ... design or research what these symbols are, then draw these with code and numbers
    - [x] Stop
    - [x] previous track
    - [x] reverse skip
    - [x] play-pause
    - [x] forward skip
    - [x] next track
    - [x] Loop Single Song Once
    - [x] Loop Single Song Infinite
    - [x] Loop Playlist Infinite
    - [x] Mute Button
    - [x] OPTIONAL Shuffle (hint, uses random)
  - [] Organize with Population Tab and Music Button Tab, each with a TAB-Driver and VOIDs connected to the Driver
  - [] Future: connect player function to visual feedback of button
    - [] Keyboard Shortcuts for button algorithms
    - [] Play-Pause: 
      - Beginning: 
      - Middle: 
      - End: 
    - [] Stop:
    - [] Mute Button:
    - [] Forward Skip:
    - [] Reverse Skip: 
    - [] Next track:
    - [] Previous track:
    - [] Loop Single Song Once
    - [] Loop Single Song Infinite
    - [] Loop Playlist Infinite
    - [] OPTIONAL Shuffle (hint, uses random)
  - [] Future: Night Mode Colors by button and default by time (binary choice, returning a choice based on preference)
    - Use of ternary operator
    - CS20 is able to use daytime procedure for more individual control
  - [] Future: Hover-over feature
  - [] Future: Visual Feature of being clicked
  - [] OPTIONAL: include following 2D Shapes code attributes
    - Note: what are the other codes noted elsewhere
    - fill() & noFill()
    - stroke() & noStroke()
    - strokeWeight() & "reset to 1 pixel"
- [] Review 2D Shapes: how is your program organized in an algorithm?
- Using Meta Data: one font, into 3 rectangles, able to move rectangles anywhere
  - [] Review music pathway
  - [] Review sound effect pathway
  - [] Review concatenating pathways to .exe, directories to sketch, any additional pathways, and file names
  - [] Loading meta data to String Variables
  - [] Review Text Code
  - [] Create Text Calculator
- Images
  - [] Background Image (no aspect ratio)
  - [] foreground Image (aspect ratio)
  - Note: any image could be aspect ratio or not
- [] **Next Item**

Future ideas
- [] display issues: landscape vs. portrait, CANVAS bigger than display & scale down
